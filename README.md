# Climate and Punishment

### The Data

[Climate and Punishment](https://theintercept.com/series/climate-and-punishment), an investigation from The Intercept’s newsroom, uses datasets for heat risk, wildfire risk, and flood risk and analyzes them against a federal government index of facilities from across the United States’s sprawling mass incarceration system. The data and analysis provide a groundbreaking, comprehensive look at the effects of the climate crisis and environmental disasters on people behind bars — and the political figures and institutional morass leaving these people at risk. Climate and Punishment includes an initial suite of three stories, a video, and an interactive map.

The data used in Climate and Punishment is drawn from different sources depending on the climate hazard being investigated. All of the work uses a 2020 register from the Department of Homeland Security of more than 6,500 carceral facilities of all kinds in the U.S. To analyze this list of facilities against wildfire risk, The Intercept used U.S. Forest Service data. For flood risk, The Intercept drew on the First Street Foundation’s “Flood Factor” risk assessment tool. And for extreme heat risk, The Intercept used the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists’ dataset and modeling.
